/**
 * Annotated abstract class (let's suppose it's named AbstractMyClass) will be
 * used as template for generating a corresponding immutable class named
 * MyClass. Annotated class is supposed to have few fields, thus no builder will
 * be generated. Immutable class will have public visibility.
 *
 * This annotation will configure
 * <a href="http://immutables.github.io/">Immutables</a> to expect the annotated
 * class to have bean style getters. The generated builder will have bean style
 * setters. Also, generated immutable objects will all have an empty object
 * retrievable with a method of the form ImmutableMyClass.of().
 *
 * NOTE: Annotated abstract class name MUST begin with 'Abstract'.
